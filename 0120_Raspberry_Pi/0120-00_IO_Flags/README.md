Input/Output flags for Raspberry Pi
===================================

This example serves as a library. It won't compile because it contains ALL input and output 
flags and there are conflicts.

Pick only the input and output flags which you need and copy&paste them into your project.

## Opening the example ##
- The **exec.mdl* file is the project main file
- Open it with RexDraw
