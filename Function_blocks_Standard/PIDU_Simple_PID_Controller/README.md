PIDU - Simple PID controller
============================

The source files illustrating the use of a simple PID controller in the REX 
Control System are located in this folder.

The PIDU function block allows bumpless switching of manual and automatic modes. 
Toggle the CNB_MAN constant to switch the mode. Change the CNR_sp constant in 
automatic mode or the CNR_hv constant in manual mode and observe the controller 
action (mv) and the process reaction (pv).

The controlled system is simulated by the MDL_PROCESS function block. Replace it
with I/O flags for real-world applications.

The signals are recorded in the TRND block which allows displaying of the trends 
(graphs) in the *RexView* diagnostic tool. 

## Timing of the project ##

The algorithm runs each 100 milliseconds (0.1 s). See the EXEC function block,  
tick x ntick0 = 0.05 x 2 = 0.1 

## User interface (HMI) ##
The example is accompanied by a HTML5-based user interface built on the WebBuDi 
framework (Web Buttons and Displays). There is also a WebWatch HMI generated
directly from *RexDraw*. Use the *RexView* tool to transfer the HMI
to the target device.
