Minimal example for the REXLANG function block 
==============================================

This folder contains the source files demonstrating the user-programmable
function block of the REX Control System called REXLANG.

The user algorithm in the *minimal_rexlang.c* file sums the two input signals
and also sums the values of two parameters. The results are published via two
output signals.

Feel free to modify the algorithm to perform your special calculations, there
are 16 inputs, 16 parameters and 16 outputs available.
