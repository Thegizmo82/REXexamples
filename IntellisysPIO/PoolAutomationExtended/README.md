Pool automation with web-based graphical HMI 
============================================

This folder contains the source files for the demonstration project on pool 
automation using the REX Control System and the Raspberry Pi minicomputer with 
the Intellisys PIO extension board.

A single onboard push-button can be used for controlling the pool. In automatic 
mode the lights and filtration pump are switched on at predefined time of day. 
Long press of the button switches the control algorithm to manual mode. In 
manual mode the user can control the lights (single push) and filtration pump 
(double push).

The control algorithm is accompanied by a web-based graphical HMI generated
from Inkscape using the RexHMI extension.

automation and control solutions using the REX Control System and the Raspberry
Pi.
