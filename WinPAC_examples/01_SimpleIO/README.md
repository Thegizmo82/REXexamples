This folder contains the source files for the demonstration project on 
accessing the input and output signals of the WinPAC 8x41 or ViewPAC

## Prerequisities ##
- RexCore must be installed and running on the WinPAC/ViewPAC device
- The input/output flags must be adjusted to comply with the I/O cards
in individual slots. 

## Running the example ##

- Open it with RexDraw, compile and download it to the target device
