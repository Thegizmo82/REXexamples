Pool automation with simple web-based HMI 
=========================================

This folder contains the source files for the demonstration project on pool 
automation using the REX Control System and the Raspberry Pi minicomputer with 
the UniPi add-on board.

This example is a modification of the original example related to the [tutorial 
on using the REX Control System](http://www.rexcontrols.com/articles/raspberry-pi-as-a-plc-pool-automation-project)
on Raspberry Pi.

The control algorithm is accompanied by a simple web-based HMI.

Visit the [REX Controls company webpage](http://www.rexcontrols.com/rex-control-system-raspberry-pi) 
for more information about the example projects and developing advanced 
automation and control solutions using the REX Control System and the Raspberry 
Pi.
