Pool automation with web-based graphical HMI 
============================================

This folder contains the source files for the demonstration project on pool 
automation using the REX Control System and the Raspberry Pi minicomputer with 
the UniPi extension board.

A single push-button connected to digital input I01 can be used for controlling 
the pool. In automatic mode the lights and filtration pump are switched on at 
predefined time of day. Long press of the button switches the control algorithm 
to manual mode. In manual mode the user can control the lights (single push) and 
filtration pump (double push).

The control algorithm is accompanied by a web-based graphical HMI generated
from Inkscape using the RexHMI extension.

automation and control solutions using the REX Control System and the Raspberry
Pi.
