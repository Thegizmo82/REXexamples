======================================

This example is a modification of the original example related to the [tutorial on using the REX Control System](http://www.rexcontrols.com/articles/getting-started-with-rex-on-raspberry-pi)
on Raspberry Pi.

## Prerequisities ##

- RexCore and RPiDrv module must be installed and running on the Raspberry Pi
- I2C bus must be enabled on the Raspberry Pi

## Running the example ##

- The **exec.mdl* file is the project main file
- Open it with RexDraw, compile and download it to the target device

## User interface (HMI) ##
