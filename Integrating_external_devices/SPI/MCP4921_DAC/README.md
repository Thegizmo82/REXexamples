Using MCP4921 DAC via SPI bus 
=============================

This folder contains the source files for controlling MCP4921 single channel
12-bit DAC via SPI bus, which is available e.g. on the Raspberry Pi minicomputer.
The example is based on the REXLANG user-programmable function block of the
REX Control System. 

It is controlled by an integer constant "CNI_DAC" (try changing it on-the-fly).

## Timing of the project ##
The algorithm runs each 100 milliseconds (0.1 s). See the EXEC function block,  
tick x ntick0 = 0.01 x 10 = 0.1 

## Prerequisites ##
- RexCore must be installed and running on the target device (Raspberry Pi).
- SPI bus must be enabled and available (e.g. /dev/spidev0.0 on the Raspberry Pi)
- The wiring must comply with the attached datasheet. 

## Running the example ##
- The **exec.mdl* file is the project main file.
- Open it with *RexDraw*.
- Specify the SPI bus by the "p0" parameter of the REXLANG function block.
- Compile and download it to the target device.
- Switch to online mode and watch the algorithm.
- Enable online monitoring of the REXLANG block (Target->Monitor selection).
