Reading MCP3422 ADC data 
========================

This folder contains the source files for reading ADC data from the MCP3422
chip via I2C on the Raspberry Pi minicomputer. The example is based on the 
REXLANG user-programmable function block of the REX Control System. 

Visit the [REX Controls company webpage](http://www.rexcontrols.com/rex-control-system-raspberry-pi) for more
