Integrating external devices in the REX Control System 
======================================================

Many devices are natively supported by the REX Control System (Modbus RTU 
devices, Modbus TCP I/O units, 1-Wire devices, Siemens PLCs, etc.). But many 
are not. It is possible to integrate these using the REXLANG programmable 
function block. You can use the following means of data exchange:

- serial communication (RS232, RS485, UART)
- I2C
- SPI
- UDP/IP
- TCP/IP

The examples in the individual folders illustrate the integration of various 
devices.
