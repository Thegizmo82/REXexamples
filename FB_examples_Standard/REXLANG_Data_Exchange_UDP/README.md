Data exchange via TCP/UDP 
=========================

This folder contains the source files for the demonstration project on data
exchange via TCP/UDP connection between two machines or computers.

Both the sender and receiver stations are implemented in the REX Control System
but any of them can be replaced by another device with TCP/UDP communication
capabilities. 

Visit the [REX Controls company webpage](http://www.rexcontrols.com) for more 
information about the example projects and developing advanced automation and 
control solutions using the REX Control System.
