Data exchange over a serial line 
================================

This folder contains the source files for the demonstration project on data
exchange over a serial line between two devices.

Both the sender and receiver stations are implemented in the REX Control System
but any of them can be replaced by another device with serial communication. 

Visit the [REX Controls company webpage](http://www.rexcontrols.com) for more 
information about the example projects and developing advanced automation and 
control solutions using the REX Control System.
