Data exchange via the RDC function block 
========================================
 
This folder contains the source files for the demonstration project on data
exchange between two target devices of the REX Control System. The example is 
based on the RDC function block (Remote Data Connection), which requires a 
licence for advanced function blocks.

In this example the station 1 is sending a sine wave, which is received by the
station 2, where it is looped back without any modification (input u2) and also 
with an offset (input u10). The data is then received by station 1.
